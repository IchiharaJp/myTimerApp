# myTimerApp
My first React App using Tailwind CSS and various npm packages to build my timer app. 
Learned and practiced the following skills:
1. React JS (JSX, using Hooks, Component approach to development)
2. Tailwind CSS (Some UI technique from Refactoring UI book, Mobile first developement)
3. npm packages (Integrating complex components or hooks from npm to integrate to my project rather than build it from scratch)
4. Using AI (Perplexity) to debug and learn syntax, or adjust some components. (Using it by some amount to learn more of npm package syntax and figure out mistakes worked well)
5. Vite (I learned that CRA is outdated already and decided to start React using Vite)
